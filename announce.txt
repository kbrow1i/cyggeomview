Subject: geomview 1.9.5-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* geomview-1.9.5-1
* geomview-devel-1.9.5-1

Geomview lets you view and manipulate three-dimensional objects: you
use the mouse to rotate, translate, zoom in and out, and so on.
Geomview can be used as a standalone viewer for static objects or as a
display engine for other programs which produce dynamically changing
geometry.  Geomview can display objects described in a variety of file
formats.  Geomview comes with a wide selection of example objects, and
you can create your own objects too.
